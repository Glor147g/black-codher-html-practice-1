    <h2>Divine Sponge Cake Recipe</h2>
    This cake is simply the most delicious fruit infused sponge you'll ever
    need. Blueberry has that jamlike quality but holds its shape while leaving a
    lovely colour. Plus it a cinch to decorate with a tasty buttercream. Try a
    simple one-to-one ratio and you'll have time for a laid back treat. Key
    Ingredients Include
    <ul>
      <li>Blueberries</li>
      <li>Buttermilk ( but yogurt and lemon will do)</li>
      <li>Self-Raising flour for ease</li>
    </ul>
